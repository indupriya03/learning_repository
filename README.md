A curated collection of exercises and practice scripts documenting my Data Science journey, covering Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more.

# Data Science Learning Repository

This repository documents my **Data Science learning journey**.  
It contains **practice scripts, exercises, and tutorials** on a variety of topics including:

- **Python fundamentals** – loops, functions, data structures  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis  
- **Data Visualization** – Matplotlib line charts, bar charts, scatter plots  

Each folder represents a **specific topic or concept**, with examples, clear comments, and explanations.  

The goal is to **track my learning progress**, **practice coding**, and **showcase my skills** in a structured, portfolio-ready format.
